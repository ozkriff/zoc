[Rust][].

(recorded with [byzanz](http://askubuntu.com/a/201018))


## Assets

Basic game assets are stored in [separate repo][].
ZoC expects them in `assets` directory:

`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc_assets assets`

NOTE: If game will not die in early stage of development I'm planning
to release actual game resources under proprietary license.


## Building

`make` or `cargo build` (latest rust-nightly is required, see `.travis.yml`).


## Running

`make run` or `cargo run` or `./target/zoc`.

(Tested in ubuntu 14.04 and win 8.1.)


## Android

For instructions on setting up your environment see
https://github.com/tomaka/android-rs-glue#setting-up-your-environment.

Then just: `make android_run`.
